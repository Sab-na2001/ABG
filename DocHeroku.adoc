= Set up a server on Heroku


The first step is to create an account https://www.heroku.com/[here].

Heroku has a https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java[tutorial] but we will see how to bypass the use of the Heroku Command Lines and use only Heroku web GUI. Therefore, the second step is to have all the necessary resources installed:
	* A free https://signup.heroku.com/signup/dc[Heroku account]
	* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 8] installed
	* http://maven.apache.org/download.html[Maven 3] installed
	* https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup[Postgres] installed locally

Once logged in Heroku website, go to your https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps[Dashboard] in order to create an app.

Click on the `new` button in the upper right corner of the window and select `Create new app`. Give the app a name and a region (usually Europe).

The app needs a database to be linked. In the heroku menu of your app, go to the `resources` tab and in the `add-ons`, research and add `Heroku Postgres`.

Add the heroku git URL to your git remote (you can find this URL in settings of your app)

A remote repository has been created for your app but it contains nothing.

To deploy code to Heroku from a `non-main` branch of your local repository (for example: `quarkus`branch), use the following syntax push it to the remoteâ€™s main branch: `git push heroku quarkus:main`. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#deploy-from-a-branch-besides-main[(see official docs)]

Once you have pushed some code, a free dyno should appear in the `resources` tab, in the form of `web java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

To see your deployed app, you click on `open app` in the upper right corner. After a delay, you should see your working app appear.
