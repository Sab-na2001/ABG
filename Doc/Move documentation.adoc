= Move Classe

_In order to describe the moves made during a game of checkers, we use the class `Move`_

== Move

The move class uses the following variables:

`to`: the square where piece is being promoted to

`from`: the square where piece is being promoted from

`promoted`: the piece that is moved

Two methods are available to create an instance of a move : either `empty` which is used at the start of a game or `given` which uses given parameters to create the move.

NOTE: the classes Piece and Square were already created in a prevous iteration
