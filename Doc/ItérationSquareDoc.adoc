= Implementaion of Square and piece for the checkers game

Marina & Dahuiss

_Our task consist on creation  two classes : Square and Piece for the checkers game._

* First of all we create the class Square basing on the UML diagrams created by Annam and Marina in the third It√©ration of UML #PR17, we also take in consideration all your remarks.
So, in this class we have 2 parameters which define the coordinate of the square and also a boolean 'color' which states if the square is white or black.
At the end of the class we have a method 'toString()', which permits us to build the square when the piece is an ordinary piece or a draught.

* In the Piece class, we have 2 parameters : 'typePiece' which specified a kind of piece, if it's an ordinary piece or a draught and a boolean 'selected' which states if a piece is selected or not. And by the way, we have a method 'toString()', which allow us to know if we have an ordinary white or black piece or if it's a white or black  draught piece. 

You can find our classes in this https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/tree/IterationSquareJava/src/main/java/io/github/oliviercailloux/assisted_board_games/checkers[package].

_We have to notice that it's just the beggining of our idea an we can improve it later in this project._
