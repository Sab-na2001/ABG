= Documentation for front in Javascript

This is a documentation for the front-end of the project in Javascript. The scripts are all placed in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/js` and we will describe their respectives roles and how you should expand the front going forward.

== The different files

=== Generic scripts

The script `common.js` contains generic functions that could be useful in other scripts. For now, it only has an object `database` with two functions in relation to the database.

* `get(url, callback)` performs a GET request with the URL in argument and executes the callback function when the request is successful.

* `post(url, data, type, callback)` performs a POST request with the URL in argument. It sends the data in argument also, with the type if specified. It executes the callback function when the request is successful.

=== Scripts specific to a page

There is one script for each html page and it should have the same name. For example, the script for `index.html` is `index.js`. This script's main purpose is to execute the actions that the user can perform on the page. 

* In the case of `index.js`, the script redirects the page to the relevant game when the user clicks on the button to play a certain game.

* `chess.js` initializes an instance of GameManager and the chess board. It also  executes the action required by the user when they click on the button corresponding: creating or loading and game.

=== Classes to manage a game

Different classes have been implemented in order to manage a game. Currently, they are only used for the game of chess (with a chess board and two players: black and white) but they can be made more generic in order to adapt to multiple types of game.
One file contains an eponymous class.

* The class `TimeManager` has one instance per player and its sole purpose is to manage that player's time. 

* The class `ChessBoardManager` is based on the module `chessboardjs` and uses it to play moves on the board and records them in the database.  

* The class `GameManager` manages the overall game, by using the classes `ChessBoardManager` and `TimeManager`.
