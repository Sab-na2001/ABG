= Documentation for the PlayerState class, enriching existing documenation

_Our goal was to improve the existing documentation specifically PlayerState class. In the sequence diagram we tried to illustrate how the application uses `PlayerState` class and exactly when._ 

When the player loads a game using `FEN` notation, the server calls `importFenGame` method in the `GameResource` class, passing it as an argument the `FEN` notation provided by the player. 

Then, inside this method `GameResource` class proceeds to creating a new instance of a `ChessBoard` (by invoking it's constructor) class passing it as an argument `FEN` string. Inside it's constructor `ChessBoard` class, creates a new instance of a `Board` class (third party chess game library) and then uses this instance to call it's method `loadFromFen`, passes as an argument to this method `FEN` string. After that, the new instance of a `ChessBoard` is returned to `GameResource`.

The next step is a creation of two instance of `PlayerState` object (one for a white player and another one for black player) by invoking it's constructor. After all, the method proceeds to creating a new instance of a `GameState` object by passing in it's constructor an instance of a `ChessBoard` and two instances of a `PlayerState`, all of which method created earlier. 

The returned instance of a `GameState` object is passed as an argument to the constructor of `GameEntity`. Inside of it GameEntity class uses provided instance of a GameState to get the existing ChessBoard and uses it to initialize it's instance variable `startBoard`. After that, a new instance of a GameEntity is returned.

At the end, the `importFenGame` method is called with `getId` as parameter and return an instance of `GameEntity`. This will return the id of the game to the `GameRessource` class, and in the same way to the player.
