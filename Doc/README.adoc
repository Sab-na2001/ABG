== Original description
Based on an idea generously provided by Vincent Giroux (thanks to him!)

The https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1648160/game-thrones-board-game-second-edition[board] https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Welcome_to_BoardGameGeek[game] essentially comes in two versions: on site, without a computer, or https://www.yucata.de/en[purely] https://fr.boardgamearena.com/[online]. In the first case, people gather and play around a board and physically embodied game elements. In the second case, people usually play at home.

The Assisted Board Game concept proposes to combine the advantages of both aspects. (For its detractors: the disadvantages of both aspects.) It is about sharing a moment together, being physically together, but with the help of a computer implementation. This will be particularly welcome for games requiring a https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2836495/republic-rome[lot] of manipulation of pieces and adjustments without decisions, or a https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1822915/zombie-15[long] set-up, but also to save the game, to replay an existing game, or to be assisted in various ways by a computer.

An Assisted Board Game is ideally composed of https://novotelstore.com/fr/table-interactive-play#prettyPhoto[an] https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/14/playtable-tablet-blockchain-technology-enhance-board-games-blokparty[interactive] https://d2rormqr1qwzpz.cloudfront.net/photos/2012/03/16/55-32402-11672_pax_catan_3_super.jpg[table], which acts as the game board, and one tablet per player. (For this project we will be satisfied with one computer acting as the interactive table and one computer per player).

The aim of this project is to build a generic system that can easily implement a wide range of games. We will start from an existing https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/blob/jetty/Doc/README.adoc[project], which has implemented a system for playing chess. The aim will be to extend the functionalities to improve this chess game, but above all to generalise the logic to allow the inclusion of other games, initially similar (checkers...) then more distinct (poker...). The system will only allow the generation of the game engine, the ambition does not extend to the automatic generation of the graphical interface which will have to be programmed manually for each game.

The existing project allows to display the chess board; to play a move; to count the remaining time; it integrates a logic of saving and restoring a game and recovering a historical game, puzzles...

== The application 
 
Our goal was to create the interface of the checkers game. The user can access the game from the menu by clicking the Play button of the checkers game.

After pressing this button, it will redirect the user to the selected game. He can start a new game or continue an existing one by using his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Draughts_Notation[Portable Draughts Notaton] (PDN).
We also made sure to respect a similar layout to the chess game in terms of colors and available buttons. The goal is to have a coherent environment through the different games.

The interface of the checkers game was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

It is interesting to know that it is not possible to load a game if no PDN has been entered.
There is now a "Quit" button to return to the Main Menu.
We also display in real time the player who has to play (Black or White).
There is also a move suggestion useful for the novices to know the possible moves of a piece in the game
