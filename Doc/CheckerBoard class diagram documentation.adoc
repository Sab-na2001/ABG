= Explanation of the class diagram

*Checkerboard*

* An instance variable *pieces* of type `MapSquareToPiece` allows to store the position of the pieces on the checkerboard. For example, a piece on the square 1 will be represented by 'Square object : Piece object' entry.

* `newInstance()` is a static factory method. We use it to create default representation of a CheckerBoard at the start of the game. This method is useful for loading an empty game board at the start of the game.

* `given` is a static factory method. We use it to create a board for which we know the position of the pieces. This method is useful for loading a game already started and restoring checkerboard's state. 

* `move` is useful to simulate the movement of a piece associated with given *squares*. This method returns a new instance of a CheckerBoard.

* `getPiece` allows to find out the *piece* located on a given square.



*Piece*

* `white` (resp. `black`) is the static factory method representing a piece of the white color (resp. black).

* `whiteQueen` (resp. `blackQueen`) is the static factory method representing a *Queen* piece of the white color (resp. blackQueen`).


*Square*

* `given` allows to create a *square* given it's number. In the Checkerboard class, 50 squares are instantiated with the method `newInstance()`.
