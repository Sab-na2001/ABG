== CURL 

To test if you can connect to the server, use the next command line:

`curl 'https://project-assisted-board-game.herokuapp.com/'`

If it does not work, you will get an error automatically.
If it does work, you will get the content of the page. 

You can also add the `--include` option to display the headers of the webpage:

`curl --include 'https://project-assisted-board-game.herokuapp.com/'`

If you only want to display the headers, you can use the next command line : 

`curl --head 'https://project-assisted-board-game.herokuapp.com/'`
