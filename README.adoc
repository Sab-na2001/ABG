L3 MIAGE in Apprenticeship

== *Project description*
In this project, the concept of the Assited Board will be implemented. The latter represents a game board as well as an interactive tablet for each player. 

For this project, we will make maximum use of existing libraries and good practices.
Development in iterations.

== *Description for iteration #1 - Project leader: Atangana Marina*

- Focus : Creation of Menu => Task 1: Creation of a class diagram of the Assisted Board Games menu. The objective of this task is to represent the different functions that will allow the user to access the different games. => Amoussou Dahuiss and Burton James

- Focus : Complete the documentation => Task 2: Creation of a Play Board Games Use Case Diagram and Game Entity Class => Hamnache Yasmine and Demay Aaron

- Focus : Complete daughter classes =>  Task 3 : Creation of the daughter classes of chess and draughts that inherit the GameEntity class => Hudayberdiyev Kerim and Shaikh Yunus Anam

=== *List of PR*

== *Description for iteration #2 - Project leader: James BURTON*


=== *Aaron DEMAY & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task: Creation of Clock Class*


Create a diagram for managing the clock which will be useful for both chess and checkers, the aim is to measure how long a game takes from start to finish and also to add a time constraint.

First, a player starts the game with 10 minutes to make a move. At each turn, the time he takes is deducted and once he makes the move, he has 30 seconds added to his remaining time. Once he has used up all of his remaining time, he will automatically lose the game.
	
This tries to solve the problems of long games and player idleness (this prevents an opponent from waiting too long).

We will be using two types of diagrams, a class diagram and sequence diagram.

=== *Anam SHAIKH YUNUS & Yasmine HAMNACHE, Task: Improvement of generalization*

Goals:

1. Have 2 interfaces: *Move* and *Board* with implementations for both games (for chess and checkers)
2. Replace list with multiplicity
3. To first focus on improving the chess game (for the next iteration), and later on work on the checkers game

This task solves the following problem: our application will be able to manage multiple types of games (at least two, chess and checkers). Because these game are different, each needs specific classes (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/2).


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & Marina ATANGANA, Task: Track all moves made by each player during a game of checkers and chess*

Goal: Create a use cases diagram showing all moves made during a game

This list of moves will be stored to a text, excel or json file. This file will be useful later on fopr analyzing all the moves, to understand why you lost, what you could have done differently etc. This file can also be imported to the webpage to show the players all the moves that were made.

This may also be used for game simulation: for example automating all moves so the player could see all their performed moves.

== *Description for iteration #3 - Project leader: Aaron DEMAY*


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & James BURTON, Task : Improvement of TaskClock Documentation*

Improvement of the TaskClock Diagram :

Improvement of the technical errors of the sequence diagram

Elaboration of a single model for the application according to the basic request of Mr. Cailloux

Improvement of the explanations of how the application works and manages the time.

=== *Yasmine HAMNACHE & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task : Improvement of MenuTask *

Improvement of MenuTask :

Creation of a sequence diagram to illustrate the interactions between the chess game and the menu

Illustration of the difference between playing a game already stared and staring a new game

=== *Marina ATANGANA & Anam SHAIKH YUNUS, Task : Case Class Documentation*

Creation of a UML diagram which illustrates Task Case that allows to record where the white and black pawns are in relation to the case of the board.

It illustrates the difference between the recording of the chess moves and checkers moves
