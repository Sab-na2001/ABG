L3 MIAGE in Apprenticeship

== *Project description*
In this project, the concept of the Assited Board will be implemented. The latter represents a game board as well as an interactive tablet for each player. 

For this project, we will make maximum use of existing libraries and good practices.
Development in iterations.

== *Description for iteration UML#1 - Project leader: Atangana Marina*

=== *Aaron DEMAY & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task: Creation of Clock Class*


Create a diagram for managing the clock which will be useful for both chess and checkers, the aim is to measure how long a game takes from start to finish and also to add a time constraint.

First, a player starts the game with 10 minutes to make a move. At each turn, the time he takes is deducted and once he makes the move, he has 30 seconds added to his remaining time. Once he has used up all of his remaining time, he will automatically lose the game.
	
This tries to solve the problems of long games and player idleness (this prevents an opponent from waiting too long).

We will be using two types of diagrams, a class diagram and sequence diagram.

=== *Anam SHAIKH YUNUS & Yasmine HAMNACHE, Task: Improvement of generalization*

Goals:

1. Have 2 interfaces: *Move* and *Board* with implementations for both games (for chess and checkers)
2. Replace list with multiplicity
3. To first focus on improving the chess game (for the next iteration), and later on work on the checkers game

This task solves the following problem: our application will be able to manage multiple types of games (at least two, chess and checkers). Because these game are different, each needs specific classes (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/2).


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & Marina ATANGANA, Task: Track all moves made by each player during a game of checkers and chess*

Goal: Create a use cases diagram showing all moves made during a game

This list of moves will be stored to a text, excel or json file. This file will be useful later on fopr analyzing all the moves, to understand why you lost, what you could have done differently etc. This file can also be imported to the webpage to show the players all the moves that were made.

This may also be used for game simulation: for example automating all moves so the player could see all their performed moves.

== *Description for iteration UML#3 - Project leader: Aaron DEMAY*


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & James BURTON, Task : Improvement of existing documentation*

Building a sequence diagram and a class diagram for GameState, PlayerState and Chess Board

=== *Yasmine HAMNACHE & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task : Sequence Diagram for chess*

Creation of a sequence diagram to illustrate the chess game.

It shows the difference between creating a new game with the "New Game" button and resuming a game with "Load Game".

=== *Marina ATANGANA & Anam SHAIKH YUNUS, Task : Square and Piece Class Creation*

Creation of an immutable class Square with two fields: vertical, horizontal allowing to locate the squares. Addition of a method IsWhite which returns the boolean True if the square is white and black otherwise. Creation of a class Diagram to describe the class. 

Creation of a Piece class specific to Checkers. Each piece has a color (black or white). This class will reuse the GetPromotion() methods to know the type of the piece (i.e. to know if we play with a checkers or chess piece).


== *Description for iteration JAVA#1 - Project leader: Aaron DEMAY*


=== *Marina ATANGANA & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task: Implementation of three new classes*


Implementation of the Piece class which represents a piece of the game of Checkers or Chess. This one will have a color and a boolean attribute which indicates if it is promoted. 

Implementation of the Square class which represents the squares of a chessboard or a checkerboard through coordinates (vertical and horizontal).

Implementation of the CheckerBoard class which allows to create the board of the checkers game.

=== *Anam SHAIKH YUNUS & Yasmine HAMNACHE, Task: Generalisation*

Creation of a GameBoard interface and a CheckersBoard class.

The CheckersBoard class implements two interfaces "GameBoard" and "CheckerBoard".


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & James BURTON, Task: Implementation of Menu*

Implementation of the Menu in HTML.

Chess interface improvement.

== *Description for iteration UML#4 - Project leader: Anam SHAIKH YUNUS*

=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task : Improvement of existing documentation*
To create a classe and/or sequence diagram that documents the "playerState" of the Chess Game.

Addition of new fonctionalities in view of possible generalization to the checker game. In this case, show all the methods to add.

=== *Marina ATANGANA & Aaron DEMAY, Task : Creation of a classe diagram of "CheckBoard" with its documentation*
To document and to do the class diagram of the class "CheckerBoard"

=== *Yasmine HAMNACHE & James BURTON, Task : Documentation of the existing application*
Continuation of the documentation of the existing classes, more specifically adding the the classes MoveDAO and GameDAO to the classes diagrams of the Documentation task (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/18[PR 28]).

Correction of sequence diagram for the time management of a game (correction TaskClock see PR#8).

== *Description for iteration JAVA#2 - Project leader: Anam SHAIKH YUNUS*

=== *Yasmine HAMNACHE & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task: Improvement of "CheckerBoard", "Piece" and "Square" classes*
First of all, improve the class `checkerboard`  that had been proposed and discussed in class.

Then, the addition of two enums : `PieceSort`  and `Side`  as they are very specific to checkers and there are only 2 possibilities in each case.

In addition, making improvements to the Piece and Square classes that were proposed before (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/21[PR21]).

In order to make sure that our methods work properly, we will eventually add unit tests.

=== *James BURTON & Aaron DEMAY, Task: "PlayerState" adaptation*
"PlayerState" adaptation to be compatible with checkers game.

=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & Marina ATANGANA, Task: Setting Of The Clock*
Displaying a real time clock for chess game.


== *Description for iteration UML#5 - Project leader: Yasmine HAMNACHE*


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV & Aaron DEMAY, Task : Correction of the class diagram of "CheckerBoard"*

Correction of the class diagram of "CheckerBoard" initially proposed ( see https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/25[PR 25].), by taking into account the exchanges on the https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/36[PR 36], which is a PR about the class `CheckerBoard` proposed in JAVA.

=== *Anam SHAIKH YUNUS & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task : Creation of a sequence diagram for Checkers*

Creation of a sequence diagram for the checkers game based on the exchanges made concerning the checkerBoard class.

=== *Marina ATANGANA & James BURTON, Task 1 : Creation of a use case diagram for the existing application*
Creation of a use case diagram for chess game.    

=== *Marina ATANGANA & James BURTON, Task 2 : Correction of the class diagram for the existing application*   
Improvement of the documentation of existing classes ( see https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/28[PR 28] ), more precisely: correct the cardinalities and improve the documentation proposed to the reader.


== *Description for iteration JAVA#3 - Project leader: Yasmine HAMNACHE*


=== *Kerim HUDAYBERDIYEV  & Dahuiss AMOUSSOU, Task: Improvement of the checkerBoard and Piece classes*
Improvement of the classes `CheckerBoard` and `Piece` by taking into account the exchanges on the https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-assisted-board-games-1/pull/36[PR 36].

=== *Anam SHAIKH YUNUS & James BURTON, Task: "PlayerState" adaptation*
`PlayerState` adaptation to be compatible with checkers game.

=== *Aaron DEMAY & Marina ATANGANA, Task: Play Button for checkers*

Our goal is to create the interface of the checkers game, so that the user can access the game from the menu by clicking the Play button of the checkers game.
After pressing this button, it will redirect the user to the selected game. He can start a new game or continue an existing one by using his FEN tag (link). We will also make sure to respect a similar layout to the chess game in terms of colors and available buttons. The goal is to have a coherent environment through the different games.
